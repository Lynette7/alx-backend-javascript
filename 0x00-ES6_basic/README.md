# ES6 Basics

- 0-constants.js: a script where the function taskFirst instantiates variables using const and function taskNext instantiates variables using let.
- 1-block-scoped.js: a script that modifies the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren't overwritten inside the conditional block.
- 2-arrow.js: a script that rewrites a standard function to use ES6's arrow syntax of the function add.
- 3-default-parameter.js: a script that condenses the internals of a function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.
- 4-rest-parameter.js: a script that modifies a function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax.
- 5-spread-operator.js: a script that, using spread syntax, concatenates 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying a function. The function body should be one line long.
- 6-string-interpolation.js: a script that rewrites the return statement to use a template literal so as to the substitute the variables defined.
- 7-getBudgetObject.js: a script that modifies a function’s budget object to simply use the keyname instead.
- 8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js: a script that rewrites the getBudgetForCurrentYear function to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object.
- 9-getFullBudget.js: a script that rewrites getFullBudgetObject to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object.
- 10-loops.js: a script that rewrites the function appendToEachArrayValue to use ES6’s for...of operator. var is not ES6-friendly.
- 11-createEmployeesObject.js: a script that writes a function named createEmployeesObject that will receive two arguments: departmentName (String), employees (Array of Strings).
- 12-createReportObject.js: a script that writes a function named createReportObject whose parameter, employeesList, is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject.
- 100-createIteratorObject.js: a script that writes a function named createIteratorObject, that will take into argument a report Object created with the previous function createReportObject.
- 101-iterateThroughObject.js: a script that writes a function named iterateThroughObject. The function’s parameter reportWithIterator is the return value from createIteratorObject.
